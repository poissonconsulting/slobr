## How to use this table

Files appear in the table as file icons alongside the extension (e.g. pdf).  
&nbsp;  

### Read/delete files

Select one or more cells in the table and click **'read cell(s)'** or **'delete cell(s)'** in the sidebar to read or delete just those cells.

Click **'read column(s)'** or **'delete column(s)'** to read or delete all files in the columns containing the selected cells.  
&nbsp; 

### Write files
To write a file, only one cell can be selected at at time. If a file already exists there it will be replaced.
